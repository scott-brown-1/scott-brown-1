### Hi there! I'm Scott.

I am a motivated learner with a desire to contribute my strong work ethic to complex business challenges. I am fascinated by data science and machine learning with a special interest in predictive analytics. I also have experience in database, API, and frontend development. Whatever the challenge, I am always excited to find data-driven solutions for people-oriented projects.
