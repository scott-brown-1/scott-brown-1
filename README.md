### Hi there! I'm Scott. 
[![LinkedIn Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Profile-informational?style=flat&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white&color=0D76A8)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-db/)

I am a motivated learner with a desire to contribute my strong work ethic to complex business challenges. I am fascinated by data science and machine learning with a special interest in predictive analytics. Whatever the challenge, I am always excited to find data-driven solutions for people-oriented projects.

I also have experience with web development and currently develop [kinetic-vision.com](https://kinetic-vision.com), [industrialscans.com](https://industrialscans.com), and [synthetictrainingdata.com](https://synthetictrainingdata.com).
